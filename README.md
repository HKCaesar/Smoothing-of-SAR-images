# Smoothing-of-SAR-images
Implementation of a paper to remove speckle noise using  ds algorithms.
Output clearly shows that output images after smoothing has lower variance than the input image.
Again output image has higher Equivalent Numbers of Looks(ENL) than the input image. 
 A larger the value of ENL usually corresponds to a better quantitative
performance.
